  <h1 style="margin-bottom:1rem;">About Me</h1>
  <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
    I’m <strong>Gabriel Dunin-Borkowski</strong>. I combine economic insight, social science perspectives,
    and data-driven analysis to tackle real-world problems. I enjoy tackling real-world challenges—ranging from 
    probability-based model derivations (like my recent <em>ROC &amp; AUC analysis</em>) to broader 
    questions in human behavior and global impact. This space is where I’ll publish short, 
    high-level explorations on topics such as machine learning metrics, effective decision-making, 
    and applied econometrics. If you’re seeking fresh insights or want to collaborate on 
    data-informed strategies, feel free to reach out at 
    <a href="mailto:gabriel.dunin@protonmail.com">gabriel.dunin@protonmail.com</a>. 
    I look forward to connecting and creating value together.
